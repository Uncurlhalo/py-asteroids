# py-asteroids
A simple python clone of the classic game "Asteroids" using the pygame library

This versions simply completes the basic requirements outlined by the project on boot.dev. I'd like to add the following features later to practice my OOP skills a bit (this is mostly so I can track what I think would be challenging and give me an opportunity to learn something)
 
* Scoring (Easy)
* Multiple lives and respawn (Easy)
* Rough asteroids (Medium)
* Wrap around the screen behavior for asteroids and player (Medium)
* Player acceleration and lingering velocity bleed (Medium)
* Triangular hitbox for player (Hard)
